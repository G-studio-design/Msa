# **App Name**: TaskTrackPro

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: User authentication and authorization to ensure that users can only access the application as per their roles and permissions. The initial app launch should display a login page with username and password forms for users from all divisions. The General Admin can add and delete user accounts from all divisions.
- Progress Upload: Each division can upload their progress updates, with fields for descriptions and completion percentage, file uploads, and notifications to the next division in the workflow (Owner -> Project Admin -> General Admin -> Architect -> Structure). Only General Admin, Project Admin, and Owner can modify the title of the progress.
- Admin Dashboard: A central dashboard to visualize the overall progress of all divisions, including status updates (e.g., pending owner approval, canceled, completed). The web application can run multiple progress instances simultaneously.
- Workflow Engine: Workflow management system to handle the order of task completions, notifications, and status updates throughout the project lifecycle, including integration with Google Calendar for scheduling.
