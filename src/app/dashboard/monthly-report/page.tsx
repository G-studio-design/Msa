The error "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {completed, inprogress, canceled})" indicates that an object, specifically the one matching the structure of your `reportData` state (which holds arrays for `completed`, `inProgress`, and `canceled` projects), is being directly rendered as a child in your JSX. React expects children to be strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, or other React elements (or arrays of these).

I have carefully reviewed the `src/app/dashboard/monthly-report/page.tsx` file, which is the most likely place for this error given the object's structure. However, I could not find an obvious instance where the `reportData` object itself is being rendered directly (e.g., `{reportData}` in the JSX). The code appears to correctly access properties of `reportData` (like `reportData.completed.length`) or map over its arrays (like `reportData.inProgress.map(...)`).

**Possible reasons for this error, even if not immediately obvious in the code, could include:**

1.  **Subtle JSX Mistake:** A less obvious placement of the `reportData` object, perhaps due to a typo or an unexpected outcome of a conditional rendering.
2.  **Prop Misuse in a Child Component:** If `reportData` (or an object with the same structure) were passed as a prop to a child component, and that child component mistakenly tried to render the entire object as its child. (This doesn't seem to be the case with the components used in `monthly-report/page.tsx`).
3.  **State Corruption (Less Likely):** A bug elsewhere could cause a state variable (that is intended to be a string or other renderable type) to be accidentally overwritten with the `reportData` object.

**Without a more specific stack trace pointing to the exact line in your JSX where the object is being rendered, it's difficult to pinpoint the precise location of the error.**

**What to look for or try:**

*   **React DevTools:** Use React DevTools in your browser. When the error occurs, it often highlights the component in the component tree that's trying to render the invalid child. This can be much more precise than the console stack trace.
*   **Comment out sections:** Systematically comment out sections of your JSX in `src/app/dashboard/monthly-report/page.tsx`, particularly the parts that render when `reportData` is populated, to try and isolate which block contains the problematic rendering.
*   **Double-check all direct and indirect uses of `reportData`**: Ensure that whenever `reportData` is used in the JSX, you are accessing a specific property or iterating over one of its arrays, rather than trying to render the object itself.

Since I cannot identify the exact line causing the issue from the information provided and my review, I cannot provide a specific code change to fix it. The error lies in how the `reportData` object is being placed into the render tree.
